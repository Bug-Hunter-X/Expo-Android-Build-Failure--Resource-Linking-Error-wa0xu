The solution requires carefully examining the app's resources (`android/app/src/main/res`) for potential conflicts, such as:

1. **Duplicate resource names:** Check for any files with identical names but different content in different resource folders (e.g., `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`).
2. **Vector Drawable issues:** Verify that your vector drawables are correctly formatted and conform to Android standards. Any errors in the SVG source files can lead to linking failures.
3. **Incorrect resource references:** Ensure all references to resources within your app's code and XML layouts are accurate.
4. **Cleaning and rebuilding:** Try cleaning and rebuilding the project using `expo prebuild --clean` and `expo run:android` before resorting to more drastic measures.
5. **Check AndroidManifest.xml:** Ensure that no conflicting permissions are defined in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

This improved resource management helps prevent resource linking errors during the build process.
